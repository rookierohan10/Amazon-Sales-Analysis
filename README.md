# Amazon-Sales-Analysis

Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this repository, we will explore and analyze an Amazon Sales Dataset provided by TwiLearn as part of an internship. The dataset contains valuable information on the company's sales, and our goal is to uncover insights, trends, and factors affecting the sales performance. To achieve this, we will leverage the power of Python, using popular data analysis and machine learning libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

**Problem Statement:**

Our main objective is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the provided Amazon Sales Dataset. We need to address the following key questions and challenges:
* **Yearly Sales Trends**: What are the annual sales trends for the company? We will delve into the dataset to identify yearly revenue patterns and understand the growth or decline in sales over time.
* **Monthly Sales Analysis**: How do sales fluctuate on a monthly basis? By examining monthly sales data, we aim to uncover seasonal patterns and understand which months are peak sales periods.
* **Yearly-Monthly Sales Trends**: Is there a correlation between specific months and the overall yearly sales performance? We will investigate whether certain months consistently contribute to higher or lower annual sales figures.
* **Identifying Sales Influencers**: What are the factors influencing sales? We will explore the dataset to identify key parameters such as product categories, pricing, marketing campaigns, and customer reviews that affect the company's sales.

* **Predictive Analysis**: Can we build a predictive model to forecast future sales trends? Using machine learning with Scikit-Learn, we will attempt to create a model that can provide insights and predictions for future sales performance.
